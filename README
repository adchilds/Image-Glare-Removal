Description:
	The purpose of the Image Glare Removal application is to provide
	a graphical user interface application to users that need to remove
	image glare from their photos. Users may load image files (.png, .jpg, etc.)
	into the program and select an area where image glare is present. Upon
	selection, the program should calculate what "should" be beneath the glare
	spot, replace the glare with dynamic pixel values, and display the updated
	image to the user.

Installation:
	The Image Glare Removal application is packaged and deployed in the *.jar file
	format. This format is a Java Archive file which packages the needed source
	files and the Java Virtual Machine into a single executable file. In order to
	run this software, the user must have properly installed the Java Runtime
	Environment (JRE) on their computer. Java can be installed for free by visiting
	Oracle's website at (without the quotes):
	"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre-7u2-download-1377135.html".
	Modern day operating systems usually package the JRE on the system, so most likely
	Java has already been installed on your system. If however it has not, please take
	the time to download and install the JRE in order to properly execute this software.
